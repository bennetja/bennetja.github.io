## Writer & translator

Hi. I’m James Bennett and this is my website.

I’m a writer and translator based in London. I translate from French and Spanish into English. I also offer reader’s reports for French and Spanish books.

I have a research master’s in Literary Studies from the University of Amsterdam and a BA in French and Spanish from Trinity College Dublin.

I have worked as a freelancer for Granta, And Other Stories and English PEN. 

My translations have appeared in [Asymptote](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2019/06/25/translation-tuesday-he-who-is-worthy-of-love-by-abdellah-taia/), Mexico City Lit and K1N. In 2023 I was awarded a PEN Presents grant to translate a sample of Colombian author Fernando Molano's novel *Vista desde una acera* (*View from a sidewalk*).

My recent fiction has been published in [3AM](https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/dignity/) and [The Dublin Review](https://thedublinreview.com/product/spring-2024/).

In 2024 I received Irish Arts Council Agility Award funding in support of my writing.

I am also the founder of indie publisher [Ssnake Press](https://www.ssnakepress.com).
