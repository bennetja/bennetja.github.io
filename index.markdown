Hi. I’m James Bennett and this is my website.

I’m a writer, translator and editor based in London. I translate from French and Spanish into English. I also offer reader’s reports for French and Spanish books.

I have a research master’s in Literary Studies from the University of Amsterdam and a BA in French and Spanish from Trinity College Dublin.

I have worked as a freelancer for Granta, And Other Stories and English PEN. 

I have published translations in Asymptote, Mexico City Lit and K1N.

My fiction has been published in 3AM and is forthcoming in The Dublin Review.

You can contact me here.
